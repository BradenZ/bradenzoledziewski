      <h3>If you can dream it, you can make it.</h3>

      <p>My three favorite colors are <a href="https://goo.gl/images/6vjxN1">red</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/images/Cjp8c6">orange</a>, and <a href="https://goo.gl/images/ZXmmzw">black</a>. I like red and black because I have a few guitars that are
        red and most of the rest are black. I also like orange because it was my dads favorite color too.
